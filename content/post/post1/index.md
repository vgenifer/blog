## What I have done 

On Monday I did my calculs homework and worked on integrals. 

On Tuesday I did wrote an essay about my family for my German classes.

On Wednesday I prepared for my calculus test and learned the parts of a gun. 

On Thursday I took my calculus test and celebrated my father's birthday. 

On Friday I did my linear algebra assignment and went to 2 calculus lectures. 

On Saturday I took all the tests I had to on tuis. 

On Saturady I spend some time with my family in our house, which is near the forest, so I got to g on a run in the forest with my brother.

So As you can see, my week has been full of tests, asignments and homework, but that is the life of a sudent, so I do not mnd the work!

## What I have learned 

This week has been kind of slow for me in the learning department. We learned my ways to solve calculs problems.
